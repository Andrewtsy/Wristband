## Introduction
The sexual assault culture present at many frat parties and dorm parties is not new knowledge, yet there have been no new solutions. Current solutions primarily only consist of reactive action—reporting sexual assault at parties only after it has happened. Many cases go unreported due to the extreme emotional cost of pursuing and prosecuting sexual offenders. That is we why sought to find something different—preventative action.

Wristband is an app that serves two purposes: increasing the awareness of the "sexual safety" of parties and creating a feed to streamline finding parties to go to/request to get into.

The first purpose is fulfilled by our report and sexual safety score. If anyone is at a party they will be able to have real-time sexual safety reports that go straight to "sober monitors" and the host of the party. Additionally, users have the ability to fill in a report after the party to detail everything that occurred. Cases of rape and drugging will automatically be sent to the police and other cases will result in a lower sexual safety score for the perpetrator, indicating to frats to not let them in in the future.

The second purpose is fulfilled through our "Request" feature where users can request access to specific parties. Additionally, rather than randomly seeing a party on your Instagram, Wristband creates a single go-to feed for people just trying to find parties.

Together with Wristband, we hope to make campus culture more open and safe for all.
